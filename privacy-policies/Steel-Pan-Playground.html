UPDATE: as of v1.0.4, Steel Pan Playground no longer participates in third party advertising or collect any data related to advertising. Disregard the following if you are using the latest version of the app.

Steel Pan Playground is a simple mobile app for emulating steel pan instruments. The app also displays ads to help cover the cost of publishing the app. The app uses [ironSource](https://www.is.com/) to effectively display these ads. 

Some notable data that is collected for advertising includes:
* Advertising ID
* IP Address
* General device information

More information can be found in ironSource's [privacy policy](https://developers.is.com/ironsource-mobile/unity/ironsource-mobile-privacy-policy/).

The developer of this app has not implemented any data collection beyond the automatic collection done through ironSource. 

Please contact [Daniel Riedel](mailto:driedel152@gmail.com) (the developer) for any questions regarding privacy.
